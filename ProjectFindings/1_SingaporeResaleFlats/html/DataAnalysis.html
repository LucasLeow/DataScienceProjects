                After choosing the relevant features from feature selection process, the number of features reduced considerably from 11 to 6.
                The resale flat data is split further by towns. In Singapore, there are 5 main regions namely North, East, South, West and Central.
                By dividing the dataset into its respective regions, it makes data analysis more concise. 
            </p>
            <p class = "set_margin">
                The current data size for each region as follows:
                <ul class = "set_margin">
                    
                    <li>North : 45,654 (21%)</li>
                    <li>East : 85,823 (39%)</li>
                    <li>South : 6178 (3%)</li>
                    <li>West : 52,029 (23%)</li>
                    <li>Central : 30,076 (14%)</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Just from this aggregation, it can be seen that there are more resale flat data from the East and West regions while the Southern region of Singapore
                has the least data.

                Pasir Ris commands the highest median prices while Geylang has the lowest median prices. Pasir Ris is known to have many scenic routes including Pasir Ris Park,
                Pasir Ris Heritage Trail, mangrove and Pasir Ris Town. It is located at the eastern edge of Singapore with a nearby Pasir Ris Beach Park.
                Furthermore, it is near Changi International Airport, Singapore's main airport which makes it convenient for residents to travel to the airport.
                It is extremely attractive since the design of that area is centred on the notion of a beachfront locale.

                In terms of Resale Price by flat type, Multi-Generation commands the highest median price while "2 ROOM" flat types have the lowest median price. 
                The naming system of "flat_type" do not denote actual number of rooms but more so of floor area in square meters. <a class = "links" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.teoalida.com/singapore/hdbflattypes/">More Info..</a>
                <br>
                This suggest that floor area is somewhat correlated to Resale Price. Multi Generation flat type was specifically designed for multigeneration families staying together
                and thus, bigger than 5-room flats.

                <br>
                From the correlation plot, the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient between "floor_area_sqm" and "resale_price" is highest at 0.77.
                This suggests that perhaps, Linear Regression can be explored, using floor_area to predict resale_price.
