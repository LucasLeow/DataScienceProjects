            <h3>Univariate Linear Regression (Resale Price vs Floor Area)</h3>
            <p>
                One of the simplest Machine Learning model is the Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is used to predict the value
                of a variable based on the value of another variable. In order for the linear model to make accurate prediction, the relationship
                between the 2 variables must be linear.  To quantify a linear relationship, Pearson Correlation Coefficient is commonly used. When
                all data points lie on the fitted linear line, then correlation will be +/- 1. (i.e perfectly positive/negative correlated).
                Moreover, confidence in inferences can be determine using p-value. Generally, lower p-value suggest greater confidence. Lower
                p-value can be achieved with more data points.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best fit linear regression line is obtained via an iteration process. An arbitrary line is first drawn and the Residual Sum of Squared
                is calculated. Residual is nothing but the distance between the data point and the line drawn. The difference is squared to eliminate negative 
                values and the results of all these differences are summed together, thereby arriving at the name - Residual Sum of Square.
