            <p>
                In this section, <b>Floor Area</b> is used to predict <b>Resale Price</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the simplest machine learning model is the Linear Regression model. Linear Regression is used to predict the value
                of a variable based on the value of another variable. In order for the linear model to make accurate prediction, the relationship
                between the 2 variables must be linear.  To quantify a linear relationship, Pearson Correlation Coefficient is commonly used. When
                all data points lie on the fitted linear line, then correlation will be +/- 1. (i.e perfectly positive/negative correlated).
                Moreover, confidence in inferences can be determine using p-value. Generally, lower p-value suggest greater confidence. Lower
                p-value can be achieved with more data points.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best fit linear regression line is obtained via an iteration process. An arbitrary line is first drawn and the Residual Sum of Squared
                is calculated. Residual is nothing but the distance between the data point and the line drawn. The difference is squared to eliminate negative 
                values and the results of all these differences are summed together, thereby arriving at the name - Residual Sum of Square.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Pearson's correlation between <b>Floor Area </b> and <b>Resale Price</b> is 0.7685, a relatively positive correlation.
                The Pearson's correlation is calculated using Covariance(x,y) / (var(x) * var(y)). The Covariance is calculated using sum((x - xbar)(y - ybar)) / (n-1).
                The purpose of Pearson's correlation is to simply quantify linear relationship between the 2 variables.
                Therefore, Pearson's correlation does not touch on how well linear line can predict results. This can be performed through Explained Variance
                R<sup>2</sup>. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The explained variance for this linear regression line is 0.59. Explained Variance is given by (var(mean) - var(line)) / var(mean) where
                var(mean) = sum((x - xbar)<sup>2</sup>) and var(line) = sum(x - xline)<sup>2</sup>. Explained variance is a metric to discuss how well line
                is fitted to our data. Hence, an R<sup>2</sup> of 59% suggest that 59% of the variation of Resale Price is explained by floor area.
                This is quite expected since from the image, most datapoints are not within the line. Hence, linear regression may not be suitable here for prediction.

            <p>In this section, <b>Floor Area</b> and <b>Remaining Lease</b> will be used to predict <b>Resale Price</b></p>.

                <img class = "center" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasLeow/DataScienceProjects/main/Images/1_SingaporeResaleFlat/MultivariateLinRegScatter.JPG">
            <p>
                Correlation between Remaining Lease and Resale price is 0.142. This suggest that the linear correlation is not very strong.
                This relatively weak correlation can be observed from the scatterplot, whereby change in any specific resale price is spread across
                remaining lease. Plotting a 3D Scatterplot with Linear Regression line is not as straightforward, especially with 85000 data points.
            </p>

                <img class = "center" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasLeow/DataScienceProjects/main/Images/1_SingaporeResaleFlat/MultivariateLinRegPred.JPG">

            <p>
                As expected, the prediction did not improve a lot. The Explained Variance is 0.592, a meagre increase of 0.02. The Mean Squared Error is very
                high at 6 billion. This is due to the fact that there are many data points (85000+) and resale prices are generally large in magnitude.
                The RMSE is at 80,151, suggesting that data points are generally $80,000 away from linear regression line.

                <h4 class = "title2">Conclusion</h4>
                Linear Regression will not be a very useful model here to predict Resale Prices.

            <h3 class = "title2">Regression Tree</h3>
            <p>
                Regression Tree is explored to determine if it can be a good model for predicting Resale Price. Regression Trees may be a better model
                to fit features with non-linear relationships. The features used for predicting Resale Price are:
                <ul>
                    <li>town</li>
                    <li>flat_type</li>
                    <li>storey_range</li>
                    <li>floor_area</li>
                    <li>flat_model</li>
                    <li>remaining_lease</li>
                </ul>
                In order to train a Regression Tree model using Scikit-Learn, some of the variables have to be label encoded since they are in string format.

            <p>
                The first step to performing Regression Tree is to find the optimum Depth.  The optimal depth determined in this scenario was 15, whereby the accuracy plateaus at about 85%.
                The performance of the Regression Tree was also not very optimal. The MSE was calculated to be 6,109,905,343. That is only a mere improvement of 300,000,000 from the linear regression model.
