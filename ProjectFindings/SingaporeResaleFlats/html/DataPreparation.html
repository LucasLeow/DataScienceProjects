            Data was stored in 5 separate csv files.

            <h2>Handling Missing Values</h2>

            <p>
                Owing to large number of entries, only resale flat data from 2012 onwards was used to speed up data processing.
                <br/>
                This reduces the number of entries from 876,607 to 219,760.
                Moreover, resale prices from earlier years are much lower compared to current market prices.<br/>
                The usage of older data will be covered in future sections, for the purpose of pattern / trend discovery.
            </p> 
             
            <h4>Identifying Missing Data</h4>
            <img width = "250" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasLeow/DataScienceProjects/main/Images/SingaporeResaleFlat/nullValues.JPG">
            <br/>        
            Only the column "remaining_lease" has null values. Singapore HDB flats are sold on 99 year leases. 
            <br>Hence, the missing 'remaining lease' values can be obtained
            by taking : 99 - (Registration Year - Lease Commence Date Year)

            <h4>Discovering non-standardized format</h4>
            <img width = "250" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasLeow/DataScienceProjects/main/Images/SingaporeResaleFlat/non_standard_values.JPG">
            <br/>
            Not all values in the 'remaining_lease' column are in standard format. Some were in integer values and some were written in years and months format as seen in the image.
            <br>Hence, the existing values have to be first standardized before the null values can be handled.

            <h2>Problem Definition and Feature Selection</h2>
            <p>  
                After cleaning the data, it is time to proceed with data analysis. It is important to first define the problem to be solved.
                For this project, the goal is to find out factors affecting resale value of HDB flats and thereby, predict future resale prices
                based on these factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 11 features and 1 label.
                <ol>
                    Features selected are:

                         <li> town </li>
                         <li> flat_type </li>
                         <li> storey_range </li>
                         <li> floor_area_sqm </li>
                         <li> flat_model </li>
                         <li> remaining_lease </li>

                </ol>

                <h5>Label : Resale Price</h5>
