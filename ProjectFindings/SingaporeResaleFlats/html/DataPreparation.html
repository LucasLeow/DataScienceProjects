            <h2>Handling Missing Values</h2>
            Owing to large number of entries, only resale flat data from 2012 onwards was used to speed up data processing. 
            This reduces the number of entries from 876,607 to 219,760. Moreover, resale prices from earlier years are much lower compared to current market prices.
            The usage of older data will be covered in future sections, for the purpose of pattern / trend discovery.
