            <h2>Splitting by towns</h2>
            <p>
                After choosing the relevant features from feature selection process, the number of features reduced considerably from 11 to 6.
                The resale flat data is split further by towns. In Singapore, there are 5 main regions namely North, East, South, West and Central.
                By dividing the dataset into its respective regions, it makes data analysis more concise. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    The current data size for each region as follows:
                    <li>North : 45,654 (21%)</li>
                    <li>East : 85,823 (39%)</li>
                    <li>South : 6178 (3%)</li>
                    <li>West : 52,029 (23%)</li>
                    <li>Central : 30,076 (14%)</li>
                    
                </ul>
                Just from this aggregation, it can be seen that there are more resale flat data from the East and West regions while the Southern region of Singapore
                has the least data.
