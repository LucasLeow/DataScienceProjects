            <h3> Background</h3>
            The Housing Development Board (HDB) of Singapore is a statutory board in Singapore responsible for Singapore's public housing.
            It was founded back in 1960 where its initial focus was to transform Singapore's mainly kampong-style settlements into more urban housing.
            With the rapid urbanization of Singapore, the prices of Singapore HDBs increased significantly. With resale flat information from 1990 to 2020,
            the goal of this data analysis is to find out what are some factors affecting the price of HDB flats.
